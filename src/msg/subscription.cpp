/**
 * \class Subscription
 *
 * A subscription object uses a \ref ProxyConnection "connection" to receive
 * \ref Message "messages" of the interested \ref Topic "topic",
 * and calls a user action on every message.
 *
 * When the subscription is constructed, the connection will be subscribed to
 * the topic, and a background thread will be started polling the connection for
 * received messages. For every message, the user-provide callback will be
 * executed.
 *
 * When the subscription is destroyed, the background thread will be stopped
 * and the connection will be unsubscribed from the topic.
 *
 * Creation and destruction of subscriptions are controlled by the pub-sub
 * actor.
